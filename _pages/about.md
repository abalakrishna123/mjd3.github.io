My name is Ashwin Balakrishna, a first year PhD student in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley.
I am advised by Professor [Ken Goldberg](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) of the [UC Berkeley AUTOLAB](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/). My research interests are in developing algorithms for imitation and reinforcement learning that enable robots to decompose and accomplish complex manipulation tasks in a sample efficient way. I got my BS in Electrical Engineering at Caltech in 2018.

I also enjoy watching/playing tennis, hiking, and eating interesting foods.

Abstract
-------
A nanoarray-enhanced, Fabry-Perot intraocular pressure (IOP) sensor has been recently fabricated for implantation in the eye for glaucoma diagnosis [1]. This work involves the development of an algorithm to process reflectivity data from the sensor collected via remote optical readout under pressure conditions observed in glaucoma patients. The method involves pressure extraction using a neural network approach based on prominent optical spectra characteristics. With the sensor in a pressure chamber, a correlation coefficient of 0.9994 was obtained between the measured and neural network extracted pressure with a run time of less than 30 s, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.

Abstract
-------
Our understanding of ocular hemodynamics and its role in ophthalmic disease progression remains unclear due to the shortcomings of precise and on-demand biomedical sensing technologies. Here, we report high-resolution in vivo assessment of ocular hemodynamics using a Fabry–Pérot cavity-based micro-optical sensor and a portable optical detector. The designed optical system is capable of measuring both static intraocular pressure and dynamic ocular pulsation profiles in parallel. Through a dynamic intensity variation analysis method that improves sensing resolution by 3–4 folds, our system is able to extract systolic/diastolic phases from a single ocular pulsation profile. Using a portable detector, we performed in vivo studies on rabbits and verified that the ophthalmic parameters obtained from our optical system closely match with tradi- tional techniques such as tonometry, electrocardiography, and photo-plethysmography.

Abstract
-------
The goal of this research is to develop a high performance system for trajectory optimization of continuously flying solar aircraft. Here, during the day solar power is used to propel the aircraft and to store energy in batteries. The battery energy is then used for continued flight at night. The objective is to find the minimum battery size needed for continuous operation by optimizing several control variables. Traditional methods, where the differential equations that describe flight motion are solved in an inner loop while an outer loop performs the optimization of the control variables, are inefficient for this problem because the boundary conditions are not only unknown, but are required to be identical due to cyclic operation. Furthermore, state variable constraints are difficult to handle with the sequential approach. To address this issue, a computationally efficient trajectory optimization method using orthogonal collocation on finite elements is first developed. After testing on a glider range optimization problem, this method was applied to the solar aircraft trajectory optimization problem. The system developed is robust, computationally efficient, and can be used to optimize and control multi-purpose solar aerial vehicles. Plans are underway to design and build a solar UAV using this optimization system.
